### 🛠️ Mechanisms(Currently Implemented)
* Grabbing Mechanism
* Teleportation
	* Locomotion Area
	* Locomotion Anchor
* Continuous Movement
* VR Hand Controls
* VR Hand Interaction
* Socket Interactor
	* Snap Interaction
	* Selectable Snap Interaction
* UI Interaction
* 3D Physics Button Interaction

### 🛠️ Known Issues
* 3D Physics button is only registering press not release and also the press is being registered for only 1 time.

Currently I am working on adding more mechanisms that can help someone during the development of their virtual reality applications/games.
